| Command                             | Description                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npx prisma init`                   | Creates the initial `prisma/` folder and `.env` file                               |
| `npx prisma migrate dev --name xyz` | Creates + runs a migration + regenerates Prisma Client                             |
| `npx prisma db push`                | Push schema changes **to the database** without creating a migration (‚ö†Ô∏è dev only) |
| `npx prisma generate`               | Manually regenerate Prisma Client (e.g., after install or pull)                    |
| `npx prisma studio`                 | Launch a GUI in your browser to explore the DB (super useful!)                     |
| `npx prisma format`                 | Auto-format your `schema.prisma` file                                              |
| `npx prisma db pull`                | Reverse-engineer schema from existing DB ‚Üí `schema.prisma`                         |
| `npx prisma migrate reset`          | Drops the DB, re-applies migrations from scratch (‚ö†Ô∏è Dev only!)                    |


## Stepa:

Now that you‚Äôve completed **advanced structured logging** and are ready to plug in **metrics collection**, here‚Äôs your realistic next step based on the **PulseHive** project goals and architecture:

## üîÑ What Comes Next

Here‚Äôs a clean prioritized roadmap for the **next milestone**:

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Finalize Metrics (today)

* [ ] Create and mount `/metrics` endpoint via `prom-client`
* [ ] Validate `http_requests_total` and `http_request_duration_seconds`
* [ ] Add 1‚Äì2 app-specific custom metrics (e.g., failed logins, successful signups)

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Setup Observability Backend (this week)

* [ ] Choose local Prometheus + Grafana **or** integrate PulseHive (if building)
* [ ] Configure Prometheus to scrape from `/metrics`
* [ ] Create a basic dashboard:

  * Requests per route
  * Errors over time
  * Avg latency per route
* [ ] (Optional) Use `winston-loki` or `logflare` to pipe logs externally

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Add 2nd Microservice (e.g., `log-api`)

This can be your **log ingestion service** that receives logs from apps via HTTP or queue:

* [ ] Create `log-api` service skeleton
* [ ] Ingest logs and correlate them using `traceId`
* [ ] Store in SQLite/PostgreSQL (for now)

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Dummy Data Simulator

To test your observability stack:

* [ ] Create a **script** or small `.NET/Node app` that:

  * Simulates 20‚Äì30 random user requests
  * Sends success/error/malformed requests
  * Triggers various metrics and logs
* [ ] Can be containerized and run during dev or CI

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 5: Frontend: Admin UI

* [ ] Basic React dashboard to view:

  * Logs by `traceId`
  * System metrics
  * Service health
* [ ] UI for correlation tracking:

  * Fetch all logs for a specific trace ID
  * Display error paths

---

## ‚úÖ Immediate Next Action for You

Since your logging is ready:

üëâ **Proceed to add `metrics.ts` as shared earlier**, test the `/metrics` endpoint locally, and confirm it's emitting Prometheus-formatted metrics.

Once done, I‚Äôll help you:

* Spin up Prometheus locally OR
* Design the PulseHive `log-api` microservice next

Let me know once `/metrics` works ‚Äî I‚Äôll guide from there.
